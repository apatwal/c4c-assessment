# c4c-assessment
My try at the C4C Technical Assessment

The HTML file reveals the different components of the website - an input box, and a button.
When the user inputs info the code checks if the text is <= 128 chars long and then pushes it to the top of the list. The JS file is what I took in from tutorials on using NODEjs and Socket but was never able to fully implement. 


This submission does not fulfill the requirements. I was not able to figure out how to allow users on different computers to post to the same board and view each otherâ€™s messages.


To test this run it on Live Server.
